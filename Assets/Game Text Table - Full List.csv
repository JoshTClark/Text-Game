Helm_Desc,"You stand at the helm of the IPRV Henrietta. There is a single door leading to the common area of the ship. <Levi> Your command terminal is showing several errors, but you are already aware of this. It’s nothing threatening and the crew is sorting it out."
Commons_Desc,"You are in the commons of the IPRV Henrietta. This room connects to the living quarters to the right, storage at one end, and the helm at the other. There is also a ladder down to the control room. <TJ_Allie><TJ><Allie>"
ControlRoom_Desc,"The Henrietta’s control room is full of screens monitoring everything you could think of for a vessel like this. A few of the screens are reporting errors, but it shouldn’t be a big issue. You’re already aware of the faults in the system scans. There is a door to the engine room and a ladder up to the commons. This room is also connected to the airlock which will let you go outside. Will sits at the end of the room speaking into a microphone and adjusting some knobs."
EngineRoom_Desc,The hum of the ship’s miniature fusion reactor fills the engine room<Joanne>.<crowbar> There is a ladder leading up to storage and a door leading to the control room.
LivingQuarters_Desc,"There are several small rooms belonging to the crew on each side of the living quarters, and in the middle are two shared bathrooms. Behind you is the door to the commons. It would be rude to search through your crew’s personal belongings so you leave them be. However you notice Joanne’s door is wide open. It looks as if someone had opened all her boxes and drawers and thrown everything on the ground. Small bits of machinery, screws, metal rods, and the like are sprinkled around the room. <welder>"
Storage_Desc,The Henrietta’s storage room is full of crates and boxes. Luckily it looks like nothing was damaged during the landing. In the back of the room is a ladder leading down to the engine room. At the other end is the door to the commons. <box> <Allie1>
Helm_Levi_Talk,"Levi: “Sorry about that captain. I just couldn’t control her well in those winds. Ship’s AI thought the best option was to find a suitable landing spot away from Gamma, and I think so too. Could’ve ended up much worse had we failed to land properly at Gamma, and there was no way we could reverse our speed after atmospheric entry. I don’t think we’ll be taking the Henrietta anywhere else soon either. This storm isn’t letting up at all. I wonder if there’s another way to get to Gamma from here.”"
