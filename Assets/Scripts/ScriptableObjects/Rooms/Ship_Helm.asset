      textResponse: "Levi: \u201CSorry about that captain. I just couldn\u2019t control
        her well in those winds. Ship\u2019s AI thought the best option was to find
        a suitable landing spot away from Gamma, and I think so too. Could\u2019ve
        ended up much worse had we failed to land properly at Gamma, and there was
        no way we could reverse our speed after atmospheric entry. I don\u2019t think
        we\u2019ll be taking the Henrietta anywhere else soon either. This storm
        isn\u2019t letting up at all. I wonder if there\u2019s another way to get
        to Gamma from here.\u201D\r"
