  description: "You stand at the helm of the IPRV Henrietta. There is a single door
    leading to the common area of the ship. Levi is reading system scans off of the
    monitor in the pilot\u2019s seat. Your command terminally is showing several
    errors, but you are already aware of this. It\u2019s nothing threatening and
    the crew is sorting it out."
