  description: "There are several small rooms belonging to the crew on each side
    of the living quarters, and in the middle are two shared bathrooms. Behind you
    is the door to the commons. It would be rude to search through your crew\u2019s
    personal belongings so you leave them be. However you notice Joanne\u2019s door
    is wide open. It looks as if someone had opened all her boxes and drawers and
    thrown everything on the ground. Small bits of machinery, screws, metal rods,
    and the like are sprinkled around the room. <welder>"
