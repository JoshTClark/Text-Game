  description: "The Henrietta\u2019s storage room is full of crates and boxes. Luckily
    it looks like nothing was damaged during the landing. In the back of the room
    is a ladder leading down to the engine room. At the other end is the door to
    the commons. One box looks particularly interesting. Branded on the side of it
    reads \u201CAquila Deep Mining Co. - Multi Purpose Terrain Vehicle\u201D."
