        She got a nice new bruise on her leg thanks to some of her tools she forgot
        to put away. Doesn\u2019t look broken or fractured, but it\u2019ll impede

        \u201CThat is a new model multi purpose vehicle. Perfect for surveying and
        traversing a planet like this. It can work as a boat when it enters water.\u201D\r\nYou
        ask if she thinks it could help us make it to Gamma.\r\nAllie: \u201CI\u2019m
        sure it could. Isn\u2019t it against protocol to do something like this?
        I guess this isn\u2019t the best situation though, so I\u2019m sure nobody
        will mind. I\u2019ll meet you in the storage room.\u201D\r\r"
