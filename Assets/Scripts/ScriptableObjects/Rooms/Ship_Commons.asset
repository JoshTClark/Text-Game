    to the living quarters to the right, storage at one end, and the helm at the
    other. There is also a ladder down to the control room. Allie and TJ are standing
    around a table discussing the recent events.\r\n\r\nAllie: \u201CCargo was secure
    and nothing looks damaged at least.\u201D\r\nTJ: \u201CWell that\u2019s a relief.
    Didn\u2019t want to end up stranded in the sticks for nothing.\u201D\r\nAllie:
    \u201CYeah though with comms down we might be here longer than we\u2019d want.\u201D\r\nTJ:
    \u201CI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll turn out fine. Joanne is fixing everything up
    right now.\u201D\r\nAllie: \u201CYeah, hopefully\u2026\u201D\r"
