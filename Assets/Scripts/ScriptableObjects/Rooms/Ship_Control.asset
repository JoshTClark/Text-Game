  description: "The Henrietta\u2019s control room is full of screens monitoring everything
    you could think of for a vessel like this. A few of the screens are reporting
    errors, but it shouldn\u2019t be a big issue. You\u2019re already aware of the
    faults in the system scans. There is a door to the engine room and a ladder up
    to the commons. This room is also connected to the airlock which will let you
    go outside. Will sits at the end of the room speaking into a microphone and adjusting
    some knobs."
