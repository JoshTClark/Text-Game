  description: "The hum of the ship\u2019s miniature fusion reactor fills the engine
    room\u2026 alongside the murmurs and hushed vulgarity of Joanne as she hurries
    back and forth between screens, valves, open panels. She doesn\u2019t even notice
    you. On the ground lies a magnetic crowbar next to a pile of some of her tools.
    There is a ladder leading up to storage and a door leading to the control room.\r"
