  ableToUseText: "Allie: \u201CNice the crowbar should be perfect for opening this
    up.\u201D\r\nYou slide the crowbar inbetween the cracks of the crate's metal
    walls. You hear a click and the metal wall suddenly becomes easy to remove, and
    it drops to the ground with a thud.\r\nAllie: \u201CI\u2019ll take her outside
    through the Henrietta\u2019s cargo hold airlock. I\u2019ll meet you and everyone
    else in the control room after.\u201D\r"
  allieNotInRoomText: You should check with Allie first so you don't end up with
    damaged cargo and a good scolding from the higher ups.
  redundantText: There is nothing to use the crowbar with here.
